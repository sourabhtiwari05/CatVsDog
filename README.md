## Introduction

In this project, we aim to create a robust CNN for image classification, focusing on the binary task of differentiating between dogs and cats. TensorFlow and Keras are employed for model development, and the project provides a detailed walkthrough of the process from data acquisition to model evaluation.

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

### Kaggle API Setup

To retrieve the required dataset, we configure the Kaggle API, set up the necessary directory structure, and ensure the proper setup of the Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) for seamless data retrieval.

### Data Extraction

The training data is extracted from a ZIP file (`dogs-vs-cats.zip`) using the `zipfile` module, streamlining the process of accessing the dataset.

## Model Development

### TensorFlow and Keras Setup

We begin by importing essential libraries and defining a data processing function to normalize the image data, laying the foundation for the subsequent model development.

### Data Processing

Normalization is applied to both the training and validation datasets, ensuring consistency in the input data for the CNN model.

### CNN Model Definition

The CNN model is defined, incorporating convolutional layers, batch normalization, max-pooling, and fully connected layers to capture intricate patterns and features in the images.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training

The model undergoes training using the designated training dataset, employing 10 epochs and validating on a separate dataset to assess its performance.

### Training History Visualization

The training and validation accuracy, as well as the training and validation loss, are visualized to provide insights into the model's learning process and performance.

## Image Prediction

To demonstrate the model's functionality, OpenCV is employed to preprocess and resize a test image. The trained model then makes predictions based on the processed image.

Feel free to explore the project, follow the steps outlined, and adapt the code for your specific image classification tasks. Enjoy experimenting with CNNs and enhancing their capabilities for your projects!
